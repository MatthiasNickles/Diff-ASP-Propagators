# Diff-ASP-Propagators
Demo code for Diff-ASP-Propagatores for differentiable ASP and SAT, using Python and Clingo's propagators.
Proof-of-concept only; for a realistic approach to Differentiable Satisfiability, see https://github.com/MatthiasNickles/DelSAT

For details on this approach, see http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2219/paper7.pdf
