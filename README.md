# Diff-ASP-Propagators
Code for Diff-ASP-Propagators for Differentiable Answer Set Programming and Differentiable SAT, using Python and Clingo's propagators.
Proof-of-concept only; for a realistic approach to Differentiable Satisfiability and Differentiable ASP (including multimodel optimization, Probabilistic Answer Set Programming and Probabilistic Satisfiability Solving), see Diff-SAT [https://github.com/MatthiasNickles/diff-SAT](https://github.com/MatthiasNickles/diff-SAT)

For details on this approach, see http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2219/paper7.pdf
